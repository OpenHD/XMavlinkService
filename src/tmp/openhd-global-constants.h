// This file should only contain const values that are needed by more than one module.
// For example, the telemetry module expects a valid wifibroadcast udp link on a specific localhost port-
// Therefore, we declare the port value here such that both modules can use it without duplicating it,
// which would lead to error-prone code.

// The ground station wifibroadcast instance(s) send data to the ground rx port
// and listen for data on the ground tx port.
// Note that the ports for the air unit are just reversed - this way, one can either run
// the telemetry service on the same system in 2 instances and they talk to each other,
// or run it on 2 different systems with wifibroadcast in between.

// I don't see a reason why not to use the same port the video is sent locally - it makes debugging much easier,
// aka for debugging one could theoretically just start QOpenHD on the air pi lol ;)
